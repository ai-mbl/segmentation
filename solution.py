#
# <div class="alert alert-info">
#
# **Overview:**
#
# 1. Prepare the 2D U-Net baseline model and validation dataset.
# 2. Implement and use the Dice coefficient as an evaluation metric for the baseline model.
# 3. Improve metrics by experimenting with:
#     - Data augmentations
#     - Loss functions
#     - (bonus) Group Normalization, U-Net architecture
# </div>
#
# ## Section 0: What we have so far
#
# You have already implemented a U-Net architecture in the previous exercise. We will use it as a starting point for this exercise.
# You should also alredy have the dataset and the dataloader implemented, along with a simple train loop with MSELoss.
# Lets go ahead and visualize some of the data along with some predictions to see how we are doing.

# %% [markdown]
# Our goal is to produce a model that can take an image as input and produce a segmentation as shown in this table.

# ## Section 1: Evaluation

# %% [markdown]
# One of the most important parts of training a model is evaluating it. We need to know how well our model is doing and if it is improving.
# We will start by implementing a metric to evaluate our model. Evaluation is always specific to the task, in this case semantic segmentation.
# We will use the [Dice Coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8rensen%E2%80%93Dice_coefficient) to evaluate the network predictions.
# We can use it for validation if we interpret set $a$ as predictions and $b$ as labels. It is often used to evaluate segmentations with sparse
# foreground, because the denominator normalizes by the number of foreground pixels.
# The Dice Coefficient is closely related to Jaccard Index / Intersection over Union.

# %% [markdown]
# PS: PyTorch already has quite a few possible data transforms, so if you need one, check
# [here](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/transforms.html#transforms-on-pil-image-and-torch-tensor).
# The biggest problem with them is that they are clearly separated into transforms applied to PIL
# images (remember, we initially load the images as PIL.Image?) and torch.tensors (remember, we
# converted the images into tensors by calling transforms.ToTensor()?). This can be incredibly
# annoying if for some reason you might need to transorm your images to tensors before applying any
# other transforms or you don't want to use PIL library at all.

# %% [markdown]
# Here is an example augmented dataset. Use it to see how it affects your data, then play around with at least
# 2 other augmentations.
# There are two types of augmentations: `transform` and `img_transform`. The first one is applied to both the
# image and the mask, the second is only applied to the image. This is useful if you want to apply augmentations
# that spatially distort your data and you want to make sure the same distortion is applied to the mask and image.
# `img_transform` is useful for augmentations that don't make sense to apply to the mask, like blurring.

# ## Additional Exercises
#
# 1. Modify and evaluate the following architecture variants of the U-Net:
#     * use [GroupNorm](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.GroupNorm) to normalize convolutional group inputs
#     * use more layers in your U-Net.
#
# 2. Use the Dice Coefficient as loss function. Before we only used it for validation, but it is differentiable
# and can thus also be used as loss. Compare to the results from exercise 2.
# Hint: The optimizer we use finds minima of the loss, but the minimal value for the Dice coefficient corresponds
# to a bad segmentation. How do we need to change the Dice Coefficient to use it as loss nonetheless?
#
# 3. Compare the results of these trainings to the first one. If any of the modifications you've implemented show
# better results, combine them (e.g. add both GroupNorm and one more layer) and run trainings again.
# What is the best result you could get?

# # Part II : Instance Segmentation :D
#
# So far, we were only interested in `semantic` classes, e.g. foreground / background etc.
# But in many cases we not only want to know if a certain pixel belongs to a specific class, but also to which unique object (i.e. the task of `instance segmentation`).
#
# For isolated objects, this is trivial, all connected foreground pixels form one instance, yet often instances are very close together or even overlapping. Thus we need to think a bit more how to formulate the targets / loss of our network.
#
# Furthermore, in instance segmentation the specific value of each label is arbitrary. Here we label each cell with a number and assign a color to each number giving us a segmentation mask. `Mask 1` and `Mask 2` are equivalently good segmentations even though the specific label of each cell is arbitrary.
#
# | Image | Mask 1| Mask 2|
# | :-: | :-: | :-: |
# | ![image](static/figure1/01_instance_image.png) | ![mask1](static/figure1/02_instance_teaser.png) | ![mask2](static/figure1/03_instance_teaser.png) |
#
# Once again: THE SPECIFIC VALUES OF THE LABELS ARE ARBITRARY
#
# This means that the model will not be able to learn, if tasked to predict the labels directly.
#
# Therefore we split the task of instance segmentation in two and introduce an intermediate target which must be:
#   1) learnable
#   2) post-processable into an instance segmentation
#
# In this exercise we will go over two common intermediate targets (signed distance transform and affinities),
# as well as the necessary pre and post-processing for obtaining the final segmentations.
#
# At the end of the exercise we will also compare to a pre-trained cellpose model.

# ## Section 1: Signed Distance Transform (SDT)
#
# First, we will use the signed distance transform as an intermediate learning objective.
#
# <i>What is the signed distance transform?</i>
# <br>  - The Signed Distance Transform indicates the distance from each specific pixel to the boundary of objects.
# <br>  - It is positive for pixels inside objects and negative for pixels outside objects (i.e. in the background).
# <br>  - Remember that deep learning models work best with normalized values, therefore it is important to scale the distance
#            transform. For simplicity, things are often scaled between -1 and 1.
# <br>  - As an example, here, you see the SDT (right) of the target mask (middle), below.

# %% [markdown] tags=["solution"]
# 1. _Why do we need to loop over dimensions? Couldn't we compute all at once?_
# To get the distance to boundaries in each axis. Regardless of the shift we choose, we will always miss boundaries that line up perfectly with the offset. (shifting only by (1, 1) will miss diagonal boundaries).
#
# 2. _What is the purpose of the pad?_
# We lose a pixel when we compute the boundaries so we need to pad to cover the whole input image.
#
# 3. _What does meshgrid do?_
# It computes the index coordinate of every voxel. Offset by half on the dimension along which we computed boundaries because the boundaries sit half way between the voxels on either side of the boundary
#
# 4. _Why do we use `map_coordinates`?_
# Boundaries are defined between pixels, not on individual pixels. So the distance from a pixel on a boundary to the boundary should be half of a pixel. Map Coordinates lets us get this interpolation
#
# 5. _bonus question: Is the pad sufficient to give us accurate distances at the edge of our image?_
# Kind of. If you assume this is the full image and no data exists outside the provided region, then yes. But if you have a larger image, then you cannot know the distance to the nearest out of view object. It might be visible given one more pixel, or there could never be another object.

#   If the closest object to a pixel is outside the receptive field, the model cannot know whether the distance is 100 or 100_000. Squeezing large distances down to 1 or -1 makes the answer less ambiguous.

# <b>Task 1.4</b>: Understanding the dataloader.
# Our dataloader has some features that are not straightforward to understand or justify, and this is a good point
# to discuss them.
#
# 1. _What are we doing with the `seed` variable and why? Can you predict what will go wrong when you delete the `seed` code and rerun the previous cells visualization?_
# The seed variable is used to ensure that the same random transform is applied to the image and mask. If we don't use the seed, the image and mask will be transformed differently, leading to misaligned data.
#
# 2. _What is the purpose of the `loaded_imgs` and `loaded_masks` lists?_
# We load the images and masks into memory to avoid reading them from disk every time we access the dataset. This speeds up the training process. GPUs are very fast so
# we often need to put a lot of thought into how to provide data to them fast enough.

# ## Section 4: Affinities

# %% [markdown]
# <i>What are affinities? </i><br>
# Affinities are a generalization of the a topic that we briefly touched on while computing the signed distance transform.
# Remember how we created a binary mask defining the boundaries between objects?
#
# ### 1D
# ```
# a a a b b c c c
#   a a a b b c c c
#   1 1 0 1 0 1 1
# ```
# and for visualization we can center the affinities:
# ```
# a a a b b c c c
#  1 1 0 1 0 1 1
# ```
#
#
# In this example we are shifting the labels by 1 pixel and comparing them to the original labels.
# We call this an affinity with offset 1. We can also compute affinities with different neighborhoods.
# For example: an offset of 2 might look like this:
# ```
# a a a b b c c c
#     a a a b b c c c
#     1 0 0 0 0 1
# ```
# And centering for visualization:
# ```
# a a a b b c c c
#   1 0 0 0 0 1
# ```
# Notice that we are just lengthening the boundary between the objects. Object b that is only 2 pixels wide no longer has any positive affinities :'(
#
# ### 2D
# In 2D, we can compute affinities in the same way. We can compute affinities in the x and y directions, as well as diagonally.
# Consider the offset (1,1). I'll use "-" to represent some padding for easier visualization.
# ```
# a a a b b -
# a a a b b -
# c c c b b -
# c c c b b -
# - - - - - -
# ```
# ```
# - - - - - -
# - a a a b b
# - a a a b b
# - c c c b b
# - c c c b b
# ```
# ```
# - - - - - -
# - 1 1 0 1 -
# - 0 0 0 1 -
# - 1 1 0 1 -
# - - - - - -
# ```
# Now lets look at some real affinities. In the next image we have computed 2 different offsets for our affinities. The first set with offsets (0,1) and (1,0), and the second set with offsets (0,5) and (5,0).
# Note we call a collection of offsets our affinity "neighborhood".

# %% [markdown]
# ![image](static/figure3/instance_affinity.png)

# %% [markdown]
# What do the colors mean in the affinities plots? We are displaying the affinities as RGB values. But we only have 2 offsets in our neighborhood, so those get assigned R and B. The G channel is faked by setting it to 0 only if both R and B are 0. This makes the background black, and pixels with both x and y affinity (inside our objects) show up white. The exceptions are at the boundaries where we now have either RG or BG (magenta and cyan) representing pixels that are on either the right or bottom boundaries of an object.

# %% [markdown]
# Note that the boundaries only show up the side of each object. This is because we usually don't bother centering the affinities. Half voxel shifts would add a lot of unnecessary complexity with unclear benefits to training.

# %% [markdown]
# The pros and cons of Affinities:
# - Pros:
#     - No limitations on shape or size. Blobby objects like nuclei, tiny objects only a pixel wide, and massive objects that could never fit in a field of view, all can be turned into affinities and back perfectly.
#     - Easy post-processing. We can do a simple watershed to get an initial segmentation. And then we can compute the average affinity between each pair of labels. This is very powerful for processing huge objects in small pieces.
# - Cons:
#     - Extreme class imbalance. The affinities are only 0 between objects and in background. This means networks can often learn to predict 1s everywhere and be mostly correct. Thus we always use some form of weighted loss when training affinities.
#     - Post processing can be sensitive to small errors. A naive agglomeration may merge fragments if a single high affinity edge is predicted between two separate objects, despite potentially thousands of low affinity edges contradicting this signal.

# %% [markdown]
# Similar to the pipeline used for SDTs, we first need to modify the dataset to produce affinities.

# Let's next look at a prediction on a random image.
# We will be using mutex watershed (see this paper by [Wolf et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12654)) for post processing. I won't dive too much into the details, but it is similar to watershed except that it allows edges to have negative weights and for splits, removing the need for finding seed points.
# However this does mean we now need a bias term since if we give it all positive edges (our affinities are in range (0, 1)) everything will join into a single object. Thus our bias should be in range (-1, 0), such that we have some positive and some negative affinities.
#
# It can also be useful to bias long range affinities more negatively than the short range affinities. The intuition here being that boundaries are often blurry in biology. This means it may not be easy to tell if the neighboring pixel has crossed a boundary, but it is reasonably easy to tell if there is a boundary accross a 5 pixel gap. Similarly, identifying if two pixels belong to the same object is easier, the closer they are to each other. Providing a more negative bias to long range affinities means we bias towards splitting on low long range affinities, and merging on high short range affinities.

# You have now completed the exercise! If you achieved an accuracy of around 0.5, that is pretty decent. If you have time to spare you can try ot push the accuracy higher. I would recommend exploring augmentations (rotations work very nicely for this task), a larger unet, and more epochs, and potentially adjusting the learning rate.
