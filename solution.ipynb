    "    - Easy post-processing. We can do a simple watershed to get an initial segmentation. And then we can compute the average affinity between each pair of labels. This is very powerful for processing huge objects in small pieces.\n",
    "- Cons:\n",
    "    - Extreme class imbalance. The affinities are only 0 between objects and in background. This means networks can often learn to predict 1s everywhere and be mostly correct. Thus we always use some form of weighted loss when training affinities.\n",
